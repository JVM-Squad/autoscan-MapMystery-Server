# Beta Test: Project of Group 40:

## Bugs:
I created a game with two players. Then with one player I searched for the other player, which kicked me out of the lobby with player2 and player1 finished the game and clicked play again. 
BUt now neither of the two players can join or create a new lobby because it say it is still in ENDGAME

## Usability:
"Register", "Login", and "Back to" button have same color but "Register" button chagnes place - not that intuitive
