## Thigns that are good:
Chat

## Bugs:
I created a game with two players. Then with one player I searched for the other player, which kicked me out of the lobby with player2 and player1 finished the game and clicked play again. But now neither of the two players can join or create a new lobby because it say it is still in ENDGAME

When the server resets and a player did not log out. They are still in the overview screen but do not have an account which leads to errors. When trying to log out nothing happens

## Usability:
"Register", "Login", and "Back to" button have same color but "Register" button chagnes place - not that intuitive

Chaning the name does not seem to work. I enter the name, I press enter the field closes and the name does not change

Chaning the avatar does not work. I can click on the change avatar button, I can click on the choose button but nothing happens. 

Open lobbies are only visible if I manually refresh the page

If all players submitted an answer they still have to wait for the timer to run out
